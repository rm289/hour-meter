**One-paragraph description for ClawHub listing:**

---

**Hour Meter** — Track elapsed time from any epoch with tamper-evident cryptographic locking. Like the analog Hobbs meters on aircraft engines, but digital. Three modes: **count up** (time since an event), **count down** (time until a deadline), and **count between** (journey progress with percentage). Set milestones at hour thresholds or percentages to trigger notifications via Discord, Telegram, or any OpenClaw channel. Lock meters with a SHA-256 integrity hash and get a human-writable paper code (with checksum!) for offline verification—write it on paper, email it to yourself, or sync the witness file to cloud storage. Perfect for career hour tracking, quit-smoking counters, project timers, warranty start dates, pregnancy countdowns, or any moment worth measuring. Includes a career projection calculator showing your remaining earning potential based on the "80,000 hours" lifetime work inventory concept.
